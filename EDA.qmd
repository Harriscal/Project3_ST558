## Introduction

This analysis uses data from the [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset), which originates from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The dataset contains over 250,000 observations collected via a health-related telephone survey.

The response variable is `Diabetes_binary`, which indicates whether the respondent has been diagnosed with diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No). The dataset includes a variety of behavioral and clinical health indicators, such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, and smoking status.

The purpose of this EDA is to investigate key features in the data and identify potential predictors for diabetes status. We aim to build a predictive model in the next phase of the project.

For this exploration, we focus on the following three variables due to their clinical relevance:

- `BMI`(*Body Mass Index*): A continuous measure of body fat based on height and weight. Higher BMI is strongly associated with obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Investigating BMI helps evaluate how excess weight relates to diabetes prevalence.
- `PhysActivity` (*Physical Activity*): A binary variable indicating whether the respondent engaged in physical activity during the past 30 days (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Regular activity improves insulin sensitivity and lowers diabetes risk, making it an important behavioral factor.
- `HighBP` (*High Blood Pressure*): A binary variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No) indicating whether the respondent has ever been told they have high blood pressure. Hypertension often co-occurs with diabetes due to shared metabolic risk factors.

These variables were selected based on strong support in medical literature and public health guidelines as key contributors to diabetes onset and progression. They also represent a mix of lifestyle and clinical health indicators.
