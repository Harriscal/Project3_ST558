## Introduction

This analysis uses data from the [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset), which originates from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The dataset contains over 250,000 observations collected via a health-related telephone survey.

The response variable is `Diabetes_binary`, which indicates whether the respondent has been diagnosed with diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No). The dataset includes a variety of behavioral and clinical health indicators, such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, and smoking status.

The purpose of this EDA is to investigate key features in the data and identify potential predictors for diabetes status. We aim to build a predictive model in the next phase of the project.

For this exploration, we focus on the following three variables due to their clinical relevance:

- `BMI`(*Body Mass Index*): A continuous measure of body fat based on height and weight. Higher BMI is strongly associated with obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Investigating BMI helps evaluate how excess weight relates to diabetes prevalence.
- `PhysActivity` (*Physical Activity*): A binary variable indicating whether the respondent engaged in physical activity during the past 30 days (1 = Yes, 0 = No). Regular activity improves insulin sensitivity and lowers diabetes risk, making it an important behavioral factor.
- `HighBP` (*High Blood Pressure*): A binary variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No) indicating whether the respondent has ever been told they have high blood pressure. Hypertension often co-occurs with diabetes due to shared metabolic risk factors.

These variables were selected based on strong support in medical literature and public health guidelines as key contributors to diabetes onset and progression. They also represent a mix of lifestyle and clinical health indicators.

## Data

The data set was imported using a relative path to ensure compatibility with reproducible workflows. It contains over 250,000 observations and 22 variables collected from the 2015 BRFSS survey. These include binary indicators for health conditions and behaviors, as well as continuous variables like BMI.

We began by checking the structure of the data and confirmed that most variables are either binary or categorical, even if numerically encoded. 

```{r Packages-Data}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#load require libraries 
library(tidyverse)

#read in the diabetes dataset as a tibble
diabetes <- read_csv("data/diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv") |> 
  as_tibble()

#check structure and dimensions of the data set
glimpse(diabetes)
dim(diabetes)

#check for missing values within the data
colSums(is.na(diabetes))

#summarize number of unique values (helps identify categorical variables)
sapply(diabetes, n_distinct)

#convert selected binary variables to factors for easier interpretation
diabetes <- diabetes |> 
  mutate(
    Diabetes_binary = factor(Diabetes_binary, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    HighBP = factor(HighBP, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    PhysActivity = factor(PhysActivity, labels = c("No", "Yes"))
  )
```

From above, to identify which variables to treat as factors, we computed the number of unique values per column. Most variables had only two distinct values, supporting their interpretation as binary indicators. A few variables like `BMI`, `Age`, `Income`, and self-reported health (`GenHlth`, `PhysHlth`, `MentHlth`) had multiple levels and were left as numeric or ordinal as appropriate.

No missing values were detected, and variable names are consistent with those provided in the Kaggle documentation. To improve interpretability during EDA, we converted the selected binary variables (`Diabetes_binary`, `HighBP`, and `PhysActivity`) used for the following analysis into factors with meaningful labels.
